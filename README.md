# midiPARSEC

midi PARser and Serial Encoding Client 

Sister repo to mechO. This parses a midi file and plays it on stepper motors connected to an arduino via serial.

As of now, the only way to run the code is to clone the repo and run it in VSCode or commandline via dotnet run. Better ways to run the code will come in the future.
